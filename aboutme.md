In recent years, I have led numerous red team assessments for many organizations include some Fortune 500 companies. I love developing sophisticated malware and have an immense passion for evasion techniques. Over the years, I released various tools such as KrbRelayUp, ShadowSpray, HWSyscalls, DavRelayUp, MalRDP and DllNotificationInjection. Here you will find posts about my discoveries, various techniques, personal opinions, etc...<br>
